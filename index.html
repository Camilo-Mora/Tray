                                    Much of the chance for survival of a tree start since you put the seed in a pot.

                                    We have found that the use of <a HREF='https://github.com/Camilo-Mora/MorasPot'>breathing bags </a>, which can be made of non-woven material or paper, provide just the extra “edge” that seedlings need to maximize their survival after planting.
                                    <br><br>
                                    However, those bags are difficult to handle at the nursery. While several trays are available commercially, they have several limitations.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This tray has been developed for the purpose of overcoming several shortcomings in the use of seedling bags at the nursery.

                            <strong>Background: </strong>
                            After several experiments and trials for mass production of "effective" seedlings, we have found that <a HREF='BreathingPot.html' class="LinkPDF">breathing bags </a> are an optimal solution: 1) the permeable membrane allows for constant oxygenation of the root system, 2) air exposure prunes the roots avoiding all together root bounding, 3) there are no problems with soil drainage, 4) by planting them directly into the ground, we avoid planting shock, and finally, and I like this one, 5) they are very cheap, about $3 cents per bag.

                            <strong>Problem of breathable bags: </strong>
                            <br> There are, however, a few downsides to breathable bags.
                            <br>
                            <br> If the bags are in contact with each other, the roots will move from bag to bag; so, you really need to keep the bags separated.
                            <br>
                            <br> The bags are difficult to keep straight up in the nursery and should be prevented of touching the ground, as roots will develop pigtail.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Solution: </strong>
                            <br> The solution to the problems of breathable bags is a tray. As my colleague Lars Jensen puts it,...a breathable pot "is only as good as the tray it’s in". 
                            <br>
                            <br>There are a few trays available commercially. However, they suffer from a few problems.
                            <br>
                            <br> First, almost all available trays are very shallow, so you really cannot have deep root trees (a big flaw).
                            <br>
                            <br> Second, as part of their design, likely to provide stiffness, these trays have many dark spaces or crevices/cavities, which are love by bugs that use them as home.
                            <br>
                            <br> Finally, such trays cannot be stacked. It may not seem as a major problem but failure to stack the trays results in major costs for shipping, and forget about storage space.
                            <br>
                            <br> So, we developed our own tray to overcome all the problems above.
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align:center;">
                                <img src="images/One Cell Tray.jpg" width="800">
                                <br>Key attributes of the tray (only one cell shown for simplicity).
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <br> The tray allows stacking bags up to 12” tall; a huge advantage for root grow. One may want taller bags for deeper roots, but be mindful that you may have to dig the holes later on!. A 12” deep bag was a good compromise.
                            <br>
                            <br> The tray allows keeping seedlings 1” apart from each other and 1.5” from the ground, which avoid root crossing between bags and maximizes air pruning, avoiding entirely root bounding and pigtail.
                            <br>
                            <br>The tray does not have cavities, which maximizes air flow and ensures full on oxygenation to the roots, while avoiding crevices; there is no place for bugs to hide on in this tray!.
                            <br>
                            <br> Finally, using second grade geometry, we utilized a cone shape for the tray, which allows the tray to be stacked while holding perfect cylindrical bags. Stacking one tray on another one adds only 1.5" in height  to the volume occupied by the first tray.
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align:center;">

                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Tray development: </strong>
                            <br> We need to start by considering that the tray needs to be stacked. One geometrical figure that can be stacked on top of each other are cones. So lets first create a cone.
                            <p style="text-align:left;">
                                <img src="images/Single cone.png" width="400">

                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <br> Second, you need the cone to hold a cylindrical bag. Hmm, how can you hold a cylinder with a cone? The solution is to create four cones and then extrude a cylinder among them. The edges of the cones can hold the cylinder, and in turn, several copies of the same structure can be stacked.
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align:left;">
                                <img src="images/Nested cylinder in four cones.png" width="400">

                                <br>
                            </p>
                            While functional, you only need the cone edges in contact with the cylinder. So we can make a revolve cut around the cylinder, leaving the cone edges with a few millimeters as bin supports.
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align:left;">
                                <img src="images/Conic support of cylinder.png" width="400">

                                <br>
                            </p>

                            <br> Next, you can add the ground isolation, or the component that will elevate the bag from the ground, needed to increase air pruning and avoid pigtail.
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align:left;">
                                <img src="images/Ground isolation.png" width="400">

                                <br>
                            </p>
                            Next, you add a top to the tray.
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align:left;">
                                <img src="images/Top tray.png" width="400">

                                <br>
                            </p>
                            It looks about all we need. So we tested the design by 3-D printing, and discover that the bins are too floppy.
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align:left;">
                                <img src="images/Prototype 01.jpg" width="400" align="center">First prototype

                                <br>
                            </p>


                            Basically, we need to create a lateral support for the bins. First, I created a full contact between neighboring bins...I tried a couple styles...
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align:left;">
                                <img src="images/Prototype 02.jpg" width="400" align="center">Second and third prototype
                            </p>
                            The new cell has lateral contact that provides good stiffness but has too much dark space; prime state for bugs. One can easily foresee a diversity of animals living there. Even with a hole/ventilation in the middle there was still too much dark space.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>So I simplified the design and created a basic horizontal bar between neighboring bins.
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align:left;">

                            <br> Finally, I selected a simpler lateral contact.
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align:left;">

                            Of course, the printer failed a few times.
                            <br>
                            <br> Now, that an optimal cell was selected, we can replicate it to create the tray by creating a grid of 3x3 cells.
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align:center;">

                            Exciting, we have a tray that fulfills all the requirements to keep breathable bags at the nursery, it is stackable, easy to handle and transport. So we printed a full version of the tray, it took four days!.
                            <p style="text-align:center;">

                            It should be ok in theory, and it did not look bad. But once we grave it with our hands, we noted that it did not have much torsion stiffness, an actual term!. Basically, if you hold the tray by the top, and turn it, it bends.

                            <br>So, back to the drawing board to find an structure that will increase torsion stiffness. I tried a lot of things.

                                <br>

                            They all should have worked in theory, but in practice, or at least on the 3D prints, they were prone to torsion. Eventually, two structures filled the bill.

                            They both were rigid. If you apply 1kg of torque to any of those two structures, in theory they bend only ~1mm. Not bad. They only downside is that any of these designs doubled the weight of the tray to more than 1kg. I guess I would have to live with that.
